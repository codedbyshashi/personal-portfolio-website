                   Hey! I'm Shashi, a BTech 3rd year student and a passionate full stack developer. I love building web applications that are both functional and clean. My main stack includes Java, Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm currently working on personal projects like a blog platform and a heart disease prediction tool to sharpen my skills. I'm also focused on improving my DSA and core computer science knowledge to prepare for product-based company placements in 2027. Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new tech and constantly learning something new.
